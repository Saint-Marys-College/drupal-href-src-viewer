drupal-href-src-viewer
======================

A script that looks through drupal 6's node revisions table and gets all of the src and href attributes to help you find unwanted absolute links, hot-linked images, and images embedded in page nodes.

To use this script you must be at least partially familiar with php because configuration is handled baked into the source code.
